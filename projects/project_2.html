        <div class="description-box">
            <p style="font-size: 16px"><strong>Description:</strong> A web application that provides users with
                real-time weather updates for their location or any specified location. Users can view current weather
                conditions, hourly forecasts, and extended forecasts. The application may also include features like
                weather alerts and interactive maps.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 16px"><strong>Implementation:</strong> To implement the Weather Forecast Application,
                you can use HTML for the layout, CSS for styling, and JavaScript to fetch weather data from a weather
                API. You'll need to display weather information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather
                icons.</p>

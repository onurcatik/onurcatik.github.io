        <div class="description-box">
            <p style="font-size: 16px"><strong>Description:</strong> A web-based music player that allows users to
                listen to their favorite songs and playlists. Users can play, pause, skip tracks, adjust volume, and
                create playlists. The music player may also include features like shuffle and repeat.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 16px"><strong>Implementation:</strong> To implement the Music Player, you can use HTML
                for the player interface, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for handling audio playback and user
                interactions. You'll need to use the HTML <audio> element or a JavaScript audio library to play music
                    files.</p>

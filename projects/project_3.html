        <h2>Online Bookstore with Shopping Cart</h2>
        <div class="description-box">
            <p style="font-size: 16px"><strong>Description:</strong> An e-commerce website where users can browse,
                search, and purchase books online. The website includes features such as a product catalog, user
                authentication, shopping cart functionality, and secure payment processing.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 16px"><strong>Implementation:</strong> To implement the Online Bookstore with Shopping
                Cart, you'll need HTML for creating product listings, CSS for styling the website, and JavaScript for
                adding interactivity like adding items to the shopping cart and updating quantities.
                Additionally, you'll need server-side programming (e.g., PHP, Node.js) for handling user authentication
                and processing orders.</p>
